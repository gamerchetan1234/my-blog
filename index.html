    <h1 id="birds">About birds</h1>
<h1>Birds are vertebrates (animals with backbones) with wings and feathers. Most birds can fly, using powerful muscles to flap their wings. ... Birds' bodies are covered with a light, tough layer of feathers and they have very light skeletons. Instead of teeth, they have hornlike beaks, or bills</h1>
<p>Mohammed Dilawar, the ornithologist known as India's sparrow man, is happy that Rajinikanth's latest movie 2.0 highlights the issue of birds and how cell phone tower radiation affects their existence.

    "The movie has highlighted the importance of birds's lives and I am sure people across the country will take this issue seriously in future because Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar have highlighted the importance of birds to our lives," Dilawar tells Rediff.com's Syed Firdaus Ashraf.
    
    2.0 shows that birds are dying because of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from cell phone towers. How far is it true?
    
    There has been research done abroad which says there is some kind of impact on birds due to cell phone towers. I was part of a committee that looked into this issue 10 years ago.
    
    The committee was constituted by the ministry of environment and forests to find out the impact of cell phones on birds, bees and wildlife in India.
    
    A lot of literature review was done then and it was found that the decline of sparrows in cities is not only because of cell phone towers. </p>
